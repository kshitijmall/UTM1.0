Description
----------------

This repository contains the necessary library and source files needed to setup, run, and solve complicated optimal control problems (OCPs) uaing the Unified Trigonometrization Method (UTM). The documentation work is in progress. 


Usage
-----

To run the code the user needs to use the following steps. These steps would be updated shortly.

::
  $ startup.m

To see the plots, the user can run the runAnalysis.m file. Before running the file, the user needs to make sure the index is right. For example, if the user wants to check the plots after 5 continuation steps, change the index number to 5. 


Documentation
-------------

The documentation work is in progress.
